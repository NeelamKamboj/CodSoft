          <h5>EARLY LIFE</h5>
          <p>Bhagat Singh, a Sandhu Jat, was born in 1907 to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati at Chak No. 105 GB, Banga village, Jaranwala Tehsil in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab Province of British India present day Pakistan. 
          His birth coincided with the release of his father and two uncles, Ajit Singh and Swaran Singh, from jail.His family members were Hindus and Sikhs; some had been active in Indian Independence movements, others had 
          served in Maharaja Ranjit Singh's army. His ancestral village was Khatkar Kalan, near the town of Banga, India in Nawanshahr district (now renamed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar) of the Punjab</p>
      <h5 style="text-transform: uppercase;">Revolutionary activities</h5>
     <ul>
         <li>Lala Lajpat Rai's death and killing of Saunders</li>
     <p>Bhagat was a prominent member of the HRA and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to HSRA in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai's death.[24] Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott.[21] However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John
     P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.</p>
     <li>Escape</li>
     <p>After killing Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V. College entrance, across the road from the District Police Headquarters. Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing them, was fatally injured by Chandrashekhar Azad's covering fire.[34] They then fled on bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses.
     Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day.[35] Dressed in western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant.
     There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore.[35] At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few days later.</p>
     <li>1929 Assembly incident</li>
     <p>Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.</p>
     <li>Assembly case trial</li>
     <p>According to Neeti Nair, associate professor of history, "public criticism of this terrorist action was unequivocal."[28] Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval of their deed.[8] Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be elated, and referred to the subsequent legal proceedings as a "drama"</p>
